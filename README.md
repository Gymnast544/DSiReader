# DSiReader

These are a few of the files I used in development of a DSi video out mod. I used a Teensy 4.1 as the microcontroller for testing. I ran into an issue of lack of knowledge on the low-level programming of the microcontroller, so was only able to poll 1-2 channels of color before the microcontroller was unable to keep up with the screen signal. Below is the image I extracted - successful decoding o the screen signal, just limited by my knowledge on how to utilize microcontrollers to their full potential.
